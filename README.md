# Multiuser
<p>Wanted a painless way to quickly enable collab on CLI.</p>
<p>Download to your home dir. Run the script with bash.</p>
<p>Follow the prompts. There's some builtin validation </p>
<p>but you don't need a PhD to follow the simple instructions.</p>
<p>Option 3 will become available in a couple days.</p>
